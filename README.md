# SpatialSiege
SpatialSiege is an immersive tower defense game that takes place within the player's own room using XR technology. Armed with a powerful plasma gun, players must defend their space from waves of drones descending from a mothership above. The drones grow increasingly aggressive, and the player's objective is to survive and shoot down all the drones without getting killed.

This project demonstrates the integration of Unity, Meta SDK, and NavMesh for pathfinding and spatial interaction within a mixed-reality environment.

# Features
**Immersive Gameplay:** Players experience the game world in their own physical space, where drones descend from above and must be shot down with a plasma gun.

**Wave System:** Each wave of drones gets progressively more challenging, with increasing numbers and more aggressive behavior.

**Real-time Pathfinding:** Drones utilize a runtime NavMesh to dynamically find paths to the player, adapting as the player moves around.

**Gun Mechanic:** The player uses a gun to shoot and destroy drones, providing a direct and immersive combat experience.

**XR Integration:** The game fully utilizes Meta SDK for voice dictation and spatial tracking, allowing the player to interact with the environment using physical movement and aiming.

# Technologies Used
**Unity:** Game engine for developing the project.

**Meta XR (MRUK):** For mixed-reality features and tracking spatial interactions.

**Meta Voice SDK:** For text dictation to improve the game experience.

**NavMesh:** Used for real-time pathfinding and navigation of drones.

# Gameplay Instructions
**Movement:** Move your head and body in the real world to look around and shoot.

**Shooting:** Use the plasma gun (trigger button) to shoot drones that spawn from above. You can reload the weapon with your controller's "A" button.

**Objective:** Survive each wave of drones. Drones get faster and more aggressive with each new wave.
